## üìñ About The Project

This project provides a robust solution for signature authentication. [Explain the problem your project solves, for example: "In an increasingly digital world, verifying the authenticity of digital documents is crucial," OR "Automating the verification of bank checks and legal documents can prevent fraud and save time."]

Our system allows users to [primary action 1] and [primary action 2].

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### For a Digital Signature Project (Cryptography)
The authentication process follows these steps:
1.  **Key Generation:** A user generates a public/private key pair (e.g., using `RSA-2048` or `ECDSA`).
2.  **Signing:** To sign a message or document, the system computes a hash (e.g., `SHA-256`) of the data. This hash is then encrypted using the user's **private key** to create the digital signature.
3.  **Verification:** To verify the signature, a recipient uses the sender's **public key** to decrypt the signature, retrieving the original hash. The recipient then computes their own hash of the received data.
4.  **Authentication:** If the decrypted hash matches the computed hash, the signature is valid, proving the sender's identity and that the data was not tampered with.

### For a Handwritten Signature Project (ML/CV)
The verification process follows these steps:
1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Input signature images are preprocessed. This includes:
    - Grayscaling and Binarization (thresholding).
    - Noise reduction and smoothing.
    - Resizing and normalization to a standard dimension.
    - (Optional) Skeletonization to get the one-pixel-thick representation.
2.  **Feature Extraction:** The system extracts key features from the preprocessed image. This might be:
    - **Classical Features:** Aspect ratio, number of contours, center of mass, etc.
    - **Deep Learning Features:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to learn a high-dimensional feature vector (embedding) that represents the signature's unique style.
3.  **Model Training (e.g., Siamese Network):**
    - The model is trained on pairs of signatures: (genuine, genuine) and (genuine, forged).
    - It learns to minimize the distance between embeddings of genuine pairs and maximize the distance for forged pairs (using a contrastive loss function).
4.  **Verification:** To verify a new signature, it is passed through the model to get its embedding. This embedding is then compared to the embedding of a known, stored genuine signature for that user. If the distance is below a certain threshold, the signature is classified as **"Genuine"**; otherwise, it is **"Forged"**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Feature 1:** (e.g., Secure key generation)
- **Feature 2:** (e.g., High-accuracy signature verification > 95%)
- **Feature 3:** (e.g., REST API for signing and verifying)
- **Feature 4:** (e.g., Batch processing of documents)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend:** [e.g., Python, Node.js, Go]
- **Frontend:** [e.g., React, Vue, HTML/CSS]
- **Key Libraries:**
  - [e.g., `pyca/cryptography` for digital signatures]
  - [e.g., `OpenCV` for image processing]
  - [e.g., `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` for the ML model]
  - [e.g., `Flask` or `FastAPI` for the API]
- **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]

```sh
# Example for a Python project
pip install virtualenv
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git)
cd your_repo
Set up a virtual environment (recommended for Python):

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install required packages:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
Run database migrations (if applicable):

Bash

python manage.py migrate
Usage
As a Command-Line Tool
To sign a file (digital):

Bash

python sign.py --file "document.txt" --private-key "mykey.pem"
To verify a file (digital):

Bash

python verify.py --file "document.txt" --signature "document.sig" --public-key "mykey.pub"
To check a signature (handwritten):

Bash

python check.py --image1 "genuine_signature.png" --image2 "test_signature.png"
